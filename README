**NOTE** 
EACH FILE CONTAINS A SPECIFIC ITERATION OF THE ROVER DESIGN. BECAUSE OF SOLIDWORK'S PACK AND GO FEATURE YOU ARE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD EACH ITERATION AND ALL THE PARTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. 
EACH ITERATION HAS A SUFFIX ASSOCIATED WITH IT (BM INDICATES BOTTOM-MOUNTED AND TM INDICATES TOP MOUNTED FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL PLACEMENT). THERE MAY ALSO BE A NUMBER IN THE SUFFIX INDICATING THE VERSION THE PART IS ASSOCIATED WITH.

UNFORTUNATELY, THE NUMBERING IS A BIT MESSY BECAUSE SOME PARTS WERE REUSED IN LATER VERSIONS. I'M HOPING TO FIX THIS ISSUE LATER WHEN I HAVE LESS OF A TIME CRUNCH.

TO AVOID CONFUSION PLEASE ENSURE EACH ASSEMBLY YOU DOWNLOAD IS IN ITS OWN **INDEPENDENT** FOLDER SO THERE IS NO MIXING OF PARTS.
